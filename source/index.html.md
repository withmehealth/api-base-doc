# Introduction

> **Base URL:**

```shell
https://api.test.withmehealth.com/api/v1/api
```

This servers as an onboarding and reference document to exchange data with WithMe in a real time manner using WithMe API (Application Programming Interface). This document specifies the URLsâ€™ and the data structures (JSON formats) for various domains along with response codes and contact information.

WithMe will accept two kinds of data formats, flat (WithMe standard) and FHIR. Our implementation team can work with you in exploring options that enables ease-of-use, interoperability, portability meeting client/vendor needs coupled with industry evolution.

# Authentication and header

<blockquote>
    <div class="box">
        <span class="method get">GET</span>
        https://api.test.withmehealth.com/api/v1/api/health
    </div>
</blockquote>

> Authenticated request:

```shell
curl "https://api.test.withmehealth.com/api/v1/api/health"
  -H "API-KEY: ${API-KEY}"
```

Key part of message exchange is the ability to trust and shield. WithMe authentication process is a MFA (multi-factor authentication) based and involves registration, validation and apikey generation.

Every user is expected to go through registration process and after successful registration there will be a unique key generated for that user (apikey) which should be used in all the subsequent calls as part of the header. User authentication and key authentication are a must before continuing to use the API.

<aside class="notice">
To authenticate, please include <code>API-KEY</code> header with your API key in every request.
